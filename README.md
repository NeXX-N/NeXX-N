# Good morning, good afternoon and good evening

## About Me

A noob in the DeepL area  
Deeply passionate about exploring various fields, including NLP, CV, LLM, and game scripting  
Always excited to discover new ideas and technologies in these areas (ACTUALLY like to have try on every "funny" place)

## Technical Environment

- Primarily use a Windows laptop for most of my development work -- not budget to build a desktop :(  
- Also, actively exploring and learning unix-based systems, aiming to expand my technical expertise

## Personal Interests

- **Music:** I am a big fan of J-POP(REOL NO.1) and classical music
- **Anime and Doujin Works:** I have a keen interest in Japanese anime and Doujin culture.  (kind of otaku,"è‚¥å®…" in chinese)
- **Running:** When not coding or catching up on new anime releases, I participate in marathon training, more for losing weight (and still on my way to finish at 4:30:00)
